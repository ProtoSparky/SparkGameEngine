## FAQ

**This code is messy, and broken**
> I've never said there was any warranty, or promise that it'll be clean. Lower your expectations

**Can i use this in school or other projects?** 
> Sure! Let your teacher know you stole the code from here, or at least change it up a little. I dont want to be screwed over due to plagirism from myself
